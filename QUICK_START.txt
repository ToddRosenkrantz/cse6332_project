Unzip the file using the command below; this will create a sub-directory called cse6332_project.

	unzip cse6332_project.zip -d cse6332_project

Change directories into that new sub-directory

	cd cse6332_project

Run 'make install', this will gather the various Python modules, project specific jar files and utilities.

	make install

If you had no error, you should now be able to start the message producers to begin 'publishing' messages
(you should stop the producers by using the stop parameter when shutting down your testing)

	./manage_producers.sh start
		and/or
	./manage_producers_ckafka.sh

Finally, this script should return without errors and give an indication of the entire process functioning.
(currently step 5 produces shows nothing due to where checkpoiint files are stored now)
	./pipeline_monitor.sh
